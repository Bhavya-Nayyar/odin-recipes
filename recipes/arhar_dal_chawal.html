        <p>
          The dish is typically made by pairing perfectly cooked rice with a flavorful dal made from a mix of toor dal (yellow
          pigeon peas) and masoor dal (brown lentils). The dal is cooked with aromatic spices, creating a rich, savory broth that
          complements the simplicity of the rice.
