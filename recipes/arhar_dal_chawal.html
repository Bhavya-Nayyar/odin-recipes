        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Dal Chawal is a classic dish in Indian cuisine, offering a wholesome and satisfying meal that combines rice and lentils.
           This comfort food is enjoyed across India and other South Asian countries, with various regional variations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dish is typically made by pairing perfectly cooked rice with a flavorful dal made from a mix of toor dal (yellow
          pigeon peas) and masoor dal (brown lentils). The dal is cooked with aromatic spices, creating a rich, savory broth that
          complements the simplicity of the rice.

            cooker. Close the lid and cook the dal. After the first whistle turn the heat down and cook on medium flame for 3 - 4
            minutes. Turn off the flame. Once the pressure ends open the lid and check if the dal is cooked or not and if it
            requires some more water. If the dal is thick in consistency then add some water for the desired flow.</li>

            Once it starts to boil close the lid and turn the flame to medium and simmer till the dal gets little mushy. Adjust the
            water according to your desired consistency. Now move the dal to a serving bowl and begin tempering.</li>
