        <h2 class="heading-one">Description</h2>
         
        <div class="div-one">
        <p>Aloo Tikki are crispy, spiced, savory patties made from mashed potatoes, ground spices, herbs, together with a binding
        ingredient like bread crumbs or cornstarch. They can be pan-fried, shallow fried or deep fried.
        An Aloo Tikki is usually popular in North India where it is sold on street carts and enjoyed by all as a scrumptious
        street food.</p>
        <p>The street style Aloo Tikki recipe usually has a savory stuffing of green peas or Paneer or chana dal, and is served
        with Chana Masala or a spicy chickpea curry or chole.
        All of this is finally topped generously with chopped onions, sweet tamarind chutney and fiery green coriander chutney.
        Sometimes, even curd/dahi (Indian yogurt) is also added to result in a dish, bursting with flavors and textures.</p>

        <ol class="second-list">
            <li>Prepare the potato-peas mixture and make tikkis with it.
            To make this easy Aloo Tikki recipe, take a glass bowl and add potatoes, peas, coriander leaves, chaat masala, chilli
            powder, cornflour, salt. Mix well all these ingredients. Once done, divide the mixture into 12 equal portions and shape
            each portion into a round tikki.</li>
            <li>Coat the tikkis with breadcrumb and shallow fry them.
            Now, to attain a crispy texture, coat the prepared tikkis with breadcrumbs on all sides by rolling it in the breadcrumbs
            filled plate. Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan over medium flame and shallow fry the tikkis, till both sides are golden
            brown in colour. You can also cook them in an air-fryer for a healthier version.</li>
            <li>Serve Aloo Tikkis hot.
            Once done, transfer the Aloo Tikkis on a kitchen towel so that excess oil is absorbed. Place the homemade Aloo Tikkis on
            a serving plate and pair them with tomato ketchup or green chutney. These tikkis taste the best when served with a
            piping hot cup of tea or coffee.</li>
